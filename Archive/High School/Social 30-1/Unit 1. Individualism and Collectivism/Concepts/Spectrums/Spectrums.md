Spectrums are systems used to organize ideas, positions, or beliefs on a nation's [[Political System]], [[Economic System]], and [[Social System]].

We use three types of spectrums: 
1. ![[Flat Line Spectrum]]
2. ![[Bent Spectrum]]
3. ![[Quadrant Spectrum]]

The idea of spectrums and the layout of them were originally taken from the National Assembly. Those who wanted change sat on the left, while those who didn't want change and wanted a return to the Status Quo Ante sat on the right.

# Extreme Beliefs

On both sides of the spectrum, extreme beliefs tend to indicate the use of more force and violence.
