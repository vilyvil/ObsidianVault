The slope at a specific point in a graph is called the instantaneous slope. Instantaneous slope can change in polynomials with degreees higher than 1 and other functions in general.

Instanteous slope is found using the limit of the slope ewuation at that point. This is done using limits either [[Finding Slope Algebraically||algebraically]] or numerically.
