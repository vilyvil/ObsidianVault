A limit can be found algebraically by using either of the two formulas:

If you substitue values into these formulas without manipulating them beforehand, you will reach 0/0, which is also known as an indeterminate value.

The aim in using both of these formulas is to algebraically manipulate them into forms that yield a y-value other than 0/0. This can be any real number or undefined.

## Use of formula 1
This formula uses the classic slope formula which defines slope as the ratio between the change in y and change in x of the equation between two points. 

Instead of using two points that are far apart, however, formula 1 involves having the distance between the points approach 0. Manipulation of the formula can avoid the answer of 0 and instead give the instanteous slope at that point.

let a = the value whose limit we want to find, and let x = an imaginary value that approaches a.

When solving this formula, keep x until the very end and subsitute a with the x value you are approaching.

Formula 1 is generally used to find singular slope values at specific points.

## Use of Formula 2
This formula is a modification of the first formula. Instead of measuring two points at x and a on the x axis, this formula integrates the distance between a and the second point in a variable labelled h. 

Since we want the second point to approach the first, approaches 0.

Just like with the first formula, you can substitute a into the formula, but keep h until the very end.

Formula 2 is generally used to find simple formulas for the slope of a line at any point by solving the formula but not substituting a.
