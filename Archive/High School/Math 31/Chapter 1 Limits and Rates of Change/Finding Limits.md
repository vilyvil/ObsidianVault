A limit is defined as the value that an equation approaches as the input approaches a value, a, from both sides.

The limit of an equation at any point can be found in three different ways:
#### 1. [[Finding Limits Numerically|Numerically]]
Manually calculating the y value of the equation as x approaches a.

#### 2. [[Finding Limits Graphically|Graphically]]
Looking at what value the equation approaches as x approaches a.

#### 3. [[Finding Limits Algebraically|Algebraically]]
Using algebra to find the value of a limit.

## Existence
A limit only exists if the graph approaches the same value from both sides. If this is not true, the limit does not exist.
