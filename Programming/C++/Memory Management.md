Unlike other programming languages, C++ allows programmers to dynamically control memory usage.

Memory in C++ programs is typically put in two places: the stack, and the heap.
When a variable is created normally it is placed into the stack, where it will be removed automatically when its enclosing function finishes. The heap is allocated manually. Heap allocated variables must be explicitly removed by the programmer.
