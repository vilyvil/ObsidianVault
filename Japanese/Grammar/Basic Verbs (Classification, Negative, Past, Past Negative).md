# Basic Verbs (Classification, Negative, Past, Past Negative)
## Classification・~る and ~う
There are two kinds of verbs in Japanese: ～る and ～う. These classifications are not clear-cut, and will involve some guessing/feeling around.

### ~る classification
All verbs that are classified as ～る verbs will always end in る. However, that does **not** mean that all verbs that end in る will be ～る verbs.

### ~う classification
～う verbs are the star of the show, the whole reason why I have to make this super long guide in the first place. They don't like fitting in with the other verbs. They have <font style="color:#FFBD59">special conjugations</font>. However, one nice thing about ～う verbs is that, if a verb does <font style="background-color:#FFBD59A6">NOT</font> end in ～る, that is, <font style="color:#FFBD59">it ends in う, つ, く, or む</font>, it is **guaranteed** to be an ～う verb.

Some ～る verbs think that being an う verb is cool and are ～う verbs even though they look like ～る verbs. These *special* ~る verbs will <font style="background-color:#FFBD59A6">always</font> have their "る" preceeded by <font style="color:#FFBD59">～い or ～え. </font>

### Notable Exceptions
する and 来る are exceptions to these two classifications, but they're not that bad, so we'll get onto that later.

## ~う verbs
~う verbs are not simple... At all... The only bright side to this is that this will be the most complex conjugation you will have to deal with, and future conjugations will seem very simple by comparison. With that out of the way, let's dive right into it.
