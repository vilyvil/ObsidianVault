Japanese pronouns don't change for case, but can have suffixes attached.

私・わたし me (normal, slightly formal when men use it)  
あたし me (casual, feminine)  
俺・おれ me (casual, masculine)  
僕・ぼく me (casual or polite, masculine)  
彼・かれ him  
彼女・かのじょ her / lady  
あなた you
All already known

達 can be used like this, but it's colloquial:
ペン達・ぺんたち The pen and stuff
