から indicates the the starting point of an action, similar to from. It works even in the abstract uses of "from".

学校から私に手紙を送った
*He sent me a letter from school*.


へ can be thought of as to/toward. It marks the direction of travel.

東京へ行く


に marks locations but also indirect objects.

学校に来た

Here is what I mean by indirect object:

研究者になる
研究者 is not receiving the action of なる. But, it is still involved with the action of なる.
ここに来た
ここ is not directly receiving the action of 来た, since 来た is an intransitive verb.
