# Creation of notes and properly linking to parts
Words with multiple characters should be handled like normal.
When a word is a single kanji with trailing ひらがな and has the same meaning as the kanji, create a note for both and copy the connection to both notes for simplicity. 

The constituent parts of a kanji should be handled as such: 
When the part is a singular kanji, always refer to the note for the kanji, not the word. Words should never be referred to as constituent parts unless in compound words.

# What to check for when inspecting a note:
- Make sure that constituent parts are properly (or at least satisfactorily) noted, especially making sure to get all of the parts that are used in the connection, and using almost all of them in the connection. Make sure to get radicals as well.
- If a note's connection does not make sense, put it in a new "confusing" or "inspect" folder for fixing in the future.
- When inspecting old kanji notes, remove the reading part. It is unnecessary. Instead of relying on the reading to figure out what a kanji is, just copy paste it into a dictionary.
