# The Purpose of This Folder
The purpose of this folder is to store characters that (obviously) are radicals, have no reading, or are generally difficult to get through the Japanese IDE.

This folder does not actually contain only radicals, and many of the parts here that are labelled radicals, are not actually radicals. The meanings given to them here may not even correspond to their actual purpose in the actual Japanese language, and have been made up instead.
