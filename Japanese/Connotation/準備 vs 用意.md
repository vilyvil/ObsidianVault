# 準備 vs 用意
Both of these words translate into nouns that refer to "preparations", but [[準備（じゅんび）]]has emphasis on the act of preparing for something, while [[用意（ようい）]]has emphasis on the idea that something is already ready to use.

"[[用意（ようい）]]用意 seems to be more common when talking about the finished stage ("I've prepared it, it's waiting to be used"), but can also be used for the actual preparations - while keeping the emphasis on the goal rather than on the process. [[準備（じゅんび）]] is more about the process."
