# Truth Tables
A simple algorithmic system that allows us to map out every Truth-Value Assignment of a sentence written in sentential logic.

## Steps
1. List letters in ==alphabetical order==
2. List out all possible combinations of Truth Values, each taking up one row.
	- There will be 2^n rows
	- Cut the number of rows in half, filling that number of rows with True and the rest with False for the first variable
	- For the next letter, cut the number in half again, filling that number of rows with True and then False and then True and so on until all the rows are filled.
	- Repeat.
3. Fill out the table using connectives.
