To make a Shortened Truth Table, make a truth table like normal and target some assumption (sentences all evaluate to True, sentences all evaluate to False, etc.) about your sentences. Then, build the truth table backwards to figure out what truth-value assignment would be necessary to make that assumption possible. 

If you find a contradiction in all cases along the way, you know that your assumption is not possible.
