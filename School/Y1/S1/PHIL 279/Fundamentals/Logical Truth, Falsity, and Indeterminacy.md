# Logical Truth/Falsity
Sentences are logically true only if they ==can't== be false.
Sentences are logically false only if they ==can't== be true.

Logically true statements are always true, and logically false statements are always false.

Quirks
- A or not-A is logically True
- A and not-A is logically False
- Arguments with logically False premises are always valid
- Arguments with logically True conclusions is always valid

## Logical Truth of Example Statements
```
O 1 + 1 = 2
We could not imagine a world where the concept, 1, is not half of 2. Fundamentally, this must be true.

O My car is red or my car is not red
Separately, these sentences are not logically true. It's possible to imagine a world where the dude's car is red or not red. However, it's not possible to imagine a world where the car is neither. It must be either.
```

```
X dogs exist
Though dogs do exist, you could imagine a world where dogs did not evolve, or get bred into the form we see them today.

X Berlin is in Germany
You could imagine a world where the city of Berlin exists in any other country, maybe because it was created as a German city, but then subsequently conquered by another nation.
```

Note that the two statements above are ==not== logically false, either.

## Logical Falsity of Example Statements
```
O Some triangles have four sides.
By definition, this is not possible. Therefore, it is logically false.

O My car is red and my car is not red.
This is not possible. Therefore, logically false.
```

# Logical Indeterminacy
This covers sentences that are neither logically true nor logically false. This includes most sentences.

O Dogs Exist
O George Bush is President
O Big Chungus is funny
O Fans are great
