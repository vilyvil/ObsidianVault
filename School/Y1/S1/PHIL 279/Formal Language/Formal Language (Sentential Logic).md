A form of logical language which puts logical statements in terms of symbols rather than linguistic sentences. This allows for the stripping down of words unnecessary to the logic and distinguishes logical sentences from real sentences.

# Types of Sentences
### Atomic Sentences
Sentences which ==cannot be broken down== while still having a truth value. Atomic sentences are ==stripped down== to their very ==bones==. ==Unnecessary words must be removed==.

Example of an atomic sentence:
- H = 'Mandy likes hiking'
### Molecular Sentences
The name of which consist of multiple atomic sentences bound together by [connectives](Connectives.md).
