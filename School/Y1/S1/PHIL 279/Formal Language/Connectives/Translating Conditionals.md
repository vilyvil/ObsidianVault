# "If" vs "Only If"
A if B
This means that **if B is true then A must be true**
so its just B ⊃ A

but "only if" has a different implication
A only if B
this means that for A to be true, then B must already be true

so we get
A ⊃ B
because **IF A is true, then B must be true**

# Example Explanation
"i'll let you play games only if you have cleaned your room"
A = kid can play games
B = kid cleaned their room

even if the kid has done all their homework, finished all their chores, etc. etc. the sentence (A ⊃ B) as whole will never be true unless they have also cleaned their room
