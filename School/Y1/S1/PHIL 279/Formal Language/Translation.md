1. Define atomic sentences
	- Ensure all negative sentences are turned positive and then flipped with negation
		- A is not B -> ~(A is B)
	- Remove extraneous words
2. Use connectives to create sentences
	- Each connective except ~ should connect exactly two terms
		- Some terms will be molecular rather than atomic
