# Disjunctive Syllogism

In English, this rule tells us that a disjunct is true when the other is false.

# Hypothetical Syllogism (HS)

This is pretty obvious. If 1 implies 2 and 2 implies 3, then 1 implies 3 because when 1 is true, 2 is true, and therefore 3 is true. 

# Modus Tollens

In English, this rule tells us that an ==antecedent must be false== if the ==consequent is false==.

# Implication (Impl)

We can convert P then Q to ~P or Q. It's hard to grasp but it works so...

# De Morgan (DeM)

In other words, you can distribute a negation (or factor it out) to flip the signs of two con/disjuncts and flip the disjunction/conjunction itself.

# Equivalence

This rule lets you turn biconditional into its longer forms. Either the conditional form, or into the form where P and Q are both true or P and Q are both false.

# Transposition (Trans)

This allows you to get the contrapositive of a conditional.
