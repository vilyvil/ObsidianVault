This applies to arguments. The corresponding material conditional of an argument is a sentence whose main connective is a conditional and is [truth functionally true](Truth-Functional%20Truth,%20Falsity,%20Indeterminacy.md) when that argument is valid.

The antecedent of the conditional is the conjunction of all of the premises. The consequent is the conclusion.
