# Truth-Functionality of Sentences
This is the SL counterpart to [[Logical Truth, Falsity, and Indeterminacy]]. 

A Truth-Functionally True sentence is basically the same as Logically Truth statement; both are always true in all cases. Formally, Truth-Functional Truth, Falsity, and Indeterminacy are defined as such:

##### Truth Functional Truth
A sentence P in ==SL== is truth-functionally true if and only if P is ==true== on every truth-value assignment.

##### Truth Functional Falsity
A sentence P in ==SL== is truth-functionally false if and only if P is ==false== on every truth-value assignment.

##### Truth Functional Indeterminate
A sentence P in ==SL== is truth-functionally indeterminate if and only if there is ==at least one truth-value== assignment where P is ==true== and ==at least one truth-value== assignment where P is ==false==.
