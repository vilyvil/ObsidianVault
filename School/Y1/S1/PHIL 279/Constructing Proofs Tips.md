# Working Backwards
One possible strategy is to use the introduction rule of whatever connective you're trying to derive, knowing that that will give it to you in the end. From there, you will know what must be proved before the introduction rule, giving you a possible path.

This strategy works best with conjunctions, conditionals, or negated sentences. It's quite difficult to use this strategy for disjunctives because it will give you two paths, meaning you might have to restart if one path is not possible.

# Working Forwards
Obviously, you can use elimination rules to get more information and to prove whatever sentences you want to prove.

# Working From Contradiction
Explosion rule, obviously.

# If nothing else works
You can use contradiction elimination to prove anything.
