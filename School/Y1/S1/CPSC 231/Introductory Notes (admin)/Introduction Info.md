Start assignments early to see what kind of things you'll have to deal with

- During the week an assignment is due, there are "Continuous Tutorials" where you can get help from TAs (any TA, not just your own)
- You can hand in assignments 5 days late in total across all assignments. After all of these are used, the assignment will not be accepted at all.
