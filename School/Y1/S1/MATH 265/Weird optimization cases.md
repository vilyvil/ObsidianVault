Having no global max/min is possible if the graph always approaches some higher/small value but never reaches it (as in a limit). An example of this is that at some point the limit of the graph approaches infinity, meaning it never reaches it.

However, it's also possible for this to happen with a constant value. It just has to happen when x-> pos/neg infinity, and where that constant value is smaller/bigger than all other values on the graph.

This is a singular point, meaning that it's possible for it to be a local extremum. 

Additionally, the graph decreases and increases around the point. This would lead us to believe it's a local minimum, but because the ACTUAL point is greater than the points left and right of it, it's actually a ==local maximum==.

Since this function is constant, its derivative is 0 everywhere. That means it has critical points on every real x. Additionally, since it's always at its biggest y value (4) and its smallest y value (4), it has a local AND global maximum at every real x.
