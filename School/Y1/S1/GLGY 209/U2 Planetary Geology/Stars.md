Stars are huge balls of almost entirely hydrogen and helium which are held together by a balance between gravity and outward radiation pressure.
As a result, stars are permanently at risk of ==gravitational contraction.==

Stars are characterized by hydrogen to helium fusion happening in their cores because of their pressure. They can vary massively in size (fractions of the size of the Sun to millions of times larger than the Sun)
