Concentrations of interstellar gas and dust.

Nebulae come from a variety of processes:
- Interstellar gas and dust concentrating itself through gravity or being concentrated
- A star or other celestial body goes through an explosion
- (rarely) Two celestial bodies collide

Some nebula are called "birthplaces of stars" because their massive amounts of gas and dust can concentrate into star systems.
