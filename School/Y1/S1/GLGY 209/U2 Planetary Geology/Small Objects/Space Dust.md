Tiny (often atomic) interplanetary and interstellar particles that float around space. Usually made of the elements C, Mg, Fe, and Ca.

It is estimated that the Earth receives 300 space dust every year.

Many of the particles of space dust we find are made of compounds that hold Oxygen isotope ==17==, which is ==extremely, extremely rare in our solar system==. This implies that the chemistry outside of our solar system could be very different from our own.
