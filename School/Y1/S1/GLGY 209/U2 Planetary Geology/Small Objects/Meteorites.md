Meteorites are fragments of space rock which fall onto planets. When observing the age of meteorites, we see that many of them are about 4.6 billion years old.

Meteorites can fall into 3 different categories based on their ==composition==:
# 1. Chondrites (Rocky Meteorites)
The most common kind of meteorite. Chondrites are named so because they often present [[Chondrules]]. Chondrites are dominated by silicate minerals.

#### Achondrites and Carboniferous Chondrites
Some chondrites do not present [[Chondrules]]. They are called ==achondrites==.
Some chondrites contain organic components. They are called ==carboniferous chondrites==.

# 2. Iron (Metallic Meteorites)
The second common kind of meteorite. Composed mostly of... I don't need to tell you. Since they also have some Nickel in them, they are usually made of some Iron-Nickel alloy.

==Together, the two categories above consist about 98% of meteorites.==

# 3. Stony-Iron (a mix of rock and metal)
The least common kind of meteorite, usually 50% silicate and 50% iron.

==Notice:== 
Silicate meteorites are most common. Silicate materials consist most of the volume of [[Terrestrial Planets]].
Iron meteorites are next most common. Iron consists the dense cores of terrestrial planets.
Stony-Iron meteorites are quite uncommon. There are small boundary layers between Iron and Silicate in terrestrial planets.
