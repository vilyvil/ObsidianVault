Small celestial bodies, most of which orbit the Sun in the area between Mars and Jupiter.

The irregular shape of asteroids implies that they are fragments resulting from planetary collisions and explosions. This shape earns them the name "flying mountains."

# Asteroid Belt
It was thought ==(not today)== that the asteroids of the asteroid belt were created from the explosion of a planet in that area. This planet was called Phaeton. This theory is not accepted today, however.

### Interesting Fact about Mars' Moons
Mars' moons look very much like asteroids, in that they are not spherical in shape. As a result, they are believed to be ==asteroids==.
