One of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, the Moon is the Earth's only natural satellite.

# Formation
The Moon is thought to have formed after the collision between Earth and a rogue planet-sized object named Theia. The planet sent a large portion of the Earth's mass into orbit, which cooled down and became the Moon we know today.

# Terrae and Marae
The Moon's surface is characterized by lands filled with dark craters called ==Marae==, which were created by ==bombardment by asteroids== which melted their surfaces. The highlands (brighter areas) of the Moon are also called ==Terrae==.

# Interesting Craters
Typically, craters seen on terrestrial celestial bodies are empty. They look like a bowl which has been permanently shoved into the surface. However, it has been observed that some of the Moon's craters are filled, not empty.

The reason for this is that these craters must have been created when the Moon was still mostly molten, but a thin crust had formed. When asteroids hit this crust, they went straight through, leaving a circle shaped hole and plunging straight into Moon lava. However, since the rest of the moon was still liquid, it simply filled right back in.
