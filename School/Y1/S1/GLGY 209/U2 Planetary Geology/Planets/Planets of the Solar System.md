The planets of the Solar System can be fit into three categories:
# 1. [[Terrestrial Planets]]
- Dense, but small
- Thin atmospheres
- Closest to the Sun
- Rocky
- Very few satellites (Earth's was created by a collision, and Mars' moons are basically just asteroids)

# 2. [Gas Giants / Jovian Planets](Jovian Planets)
- Not very dense at all, much larger
- Thick atmosphere
- ==All of them have rings==
- Dominated by gasses

# 3. Icy Planets
- Literally just Pluto
- 9th "planet"
- Covered in ice
