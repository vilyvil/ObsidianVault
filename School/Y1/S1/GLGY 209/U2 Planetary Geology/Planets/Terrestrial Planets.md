The terrestrial planets are the smallest planets in the Solar System. They are made of mostly rocks and metal and are the most dense planets in the Solar System.

We can understand their ==internal structures== by analyzing the ==irregularities in their orbits==. Further irregularities caused by their natural satellites help us understand further.

# Core and Mantle/Crust
The cores of the terrestrial planets are all characterized by mostly Iron accompanied by Nickel.

In the rest of the planets, we generally see silicate (Si and O) minerals.
