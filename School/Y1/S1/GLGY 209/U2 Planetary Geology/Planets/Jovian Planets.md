The Jovian planets are the largest planets in the solar system, and also the furthest away. Neptune, the smallest of the gas giants, is about 4 times larger than the Earth. Being made of gases, the Jovian planets are much less dense than the rocky Terrestrial planets.

# Internal Structure
Cores are predominately solid silicate
The rest of the planet is made of hydrogen and helium, which transitions along with depth from gaseous, liquid, and then solid near the core.

# Other special characteristics
- All have rings
- All have a large number of satellites, more of which are continually being discovered.
	- About Jupiter's moons:
		- Io is the second volcanic celestial body that we know of, the other being our own planet.
		- Europa is covered in thick sheets of ice, under which the planet houses vast oceans of water and liquid hydrocarbons.
