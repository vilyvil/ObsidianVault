Solar Nebula Theory explains the formation of our solar system. It proposes that our solar system originated ==5 billion years ago== from a cold cloud of ==interstellar gas and dust== called the Solar Nebula. Due to the mutual attraction of gas and dust, as well as outside gravitational disturbances, this cloud of gas contracted and formed the solar system we know today.

For the purposes of our class, SNT is split into 6 phases, which ended ==4.6 billion years ago==. This date is also considered the birth of the Earth.

# Phase 1
### Cold Cloud of Gas and dust
==5 billion years ago==, the Solar System was a huge cloud of mostly H and He. Some traces of Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Carbon were also present. Due to gravity the cloud contracted and began to rotate (mostly contraction).

Contraction was sped up by gravitational disturbance from passing objects.

# Phase 2
### Rotation and Heating
During this time, the cloud began to ==rotate much faster== than it contracted. Collisions between particles caused the cloud to ==heat up==.

##### Consequences
The cloud took a ==lens shape==.
Matter ==concentrated and heated in the center==

# Phase 3
### Swirling and beginning of Accretion
Particles began to aggregate into ==irregular== rock fragments up to ==several meters in diameter==. Most of the mass was concentrated in the center, with the rest of the mass in ==concentric rings== around the center.

Collisions and gravity between rocks caused more turbulence in the cloud. Additionally, some rocks would swirl around each other as a result of their gravity.

# Phase 4
### Formation of Protoplanets
At this point the concentric rings around the center collapsed into ==small== planet-like objects. These protoplanets were ==much more numerous== than our planets today. 

Additionally, frequent collisions made them hot enough to melt iron and nickel, meaning all of their iron was liquid. As a result, ==gravitational differentiation== took place, a process where the heavy elements like iron and nickel concentrated in the center, while silicates and other lighter materials formed layers according to density.

Also, the protosun's temperature reached millions of degrees.
# Phase 5
### Ignition of the Sun
The Sun reached the pressures and temperatures necessary to begin fusion in its core, turning it into a star. 

This began the solar wind, ==blowing leftover gas in the Sun's periphery away== from the Terrestrial planets and towards the Jovian planets. This is apparently the ==reason why they are mostly gas==. (they were formerly rocky, hence their silicate cores)

The solar wind helped induce the dynamo effect in the terrestrial planets, giving them their magnetic fields.

# Phase 6
### Collision and Readjustment: Solar System settles down
Leftover planets went through massive collisions, creating the meteorites we see today (most of them are dated to 4.6 billion years ago). This is why meteorites follow the composition of terrestrial planets. They were made from them.

Many proto planets did not make it.
