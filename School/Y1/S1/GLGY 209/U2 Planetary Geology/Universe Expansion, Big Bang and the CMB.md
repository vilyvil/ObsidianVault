# Red and Blue shift
About a century ago, it was observed that the light from far-away galaxies was shifted to the red side of the color spectrum. Conversely, the light from closer galaxies seemed to be shifted to the blue side of the color spectrum.

As the spectrum from blue to red goes from short to long, scientists concluded that the so-called red-shift and blue-shift were a result of the Doppler Effect. In other words, the galaxies emitting this light ==were moving==!

Blue-shifted galaxies are moving towards us due to gravity.
Red-shifted galaxies are moving away from us because...

# The Universe is Expanding
A few decades after red and blue shift were discovered, Edwin ==Hubble== discovered that galaxies seem to be receding faster the closer they are. This led scientists to conclude that the ==Universe itself is expanding.==

Extrapolating our calculations of the Universe's rate of expansion, we estimate that the Universe was born about ==13.7 billion years (remember this!)== ago. How did this happen?

# Big Bang Theory
The beginning of the Universe's expansion is thought to have begun when the Universe was a very small point, when all of the energy of the Universe was concentrated in a very small place (like TINY).

Several measurements of the CMB, cosmic microwave background, by the COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) and the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) confirmed the Big Bang Theory by mapping the universe's temperature fluctuations in its very first stages of existence. The CMB is considered an ==echo== of the Big Bang.
