# Folds
![[Pasted image 20231119145839.png]]
Layers keep their cohesion (ie. remain unbroken), but the shape is distorted. This is more common underground due to the high pressures.

[[Folds]] come in different types: Anticline, Syncline, and Monocline.
# Faults

Layer is broken and planar cohesion is lost. Caused by presence of water?

[[Faults]] come in different types: Normal, Reverse, and Thrust.
