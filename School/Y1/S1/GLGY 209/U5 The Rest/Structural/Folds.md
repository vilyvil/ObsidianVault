We will focus mostly on anticlines.
# Anticline & Synclines
A strong force causes rock to fold into itself. Anticlines and synclines happen at the "turning points" of these folds.

An anticline is the place where layers converge upwards. A syncline is the place where layers converge downwards.
### Elements of an anticline
| Limbs                  | Hinge                           | Plunge                                               | Axial Plane                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The "arms" of the fold | The "turning point" of the fold | The angle of the anticline with respect to the floor | A plane which goes through the middle of the hinge of each layer |
|                        |                                 | Horizontal: flat with floor, Plunging: Inclined      | Upright, inclined, overturned, recumbent                         |

### Classes of anticline
Class is based on the axial plane's inclination

| Upright                        | Inclined                                          | Overturned                                  | Recumbent                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| AP perpendicular to the ground | AP forms angle, limbs dig in different directions | AP forms angle, limbs dig in same direction | AP basically parallel to the ground |
# Monocline
An insufficiently strong force folds the rock, but not enough to make it fold back in the other direction.
