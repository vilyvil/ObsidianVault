# Force
Push or pull that results in the change in motion of a mass

# Stress
Force per unit area

| Displacement    | Rotation        | Strain          |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Change in Place | Change in Angle | Change in Shape |

# Confining Stress
Force is equal on all directions

# Differential Stress
Force differs per direction, ==much more common==
#### Compression
Two forces pushing against each other
#### Tension
Rock is stretched
#### Shear
Two forces applied in opposite directions offset of one another, causing a tearing motion in the middle.
