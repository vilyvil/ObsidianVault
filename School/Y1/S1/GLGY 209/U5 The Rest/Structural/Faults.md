When cohesion of layers is broken and the two broken parts begin to move apart.

When the two parts DON'T move apart, it's called a joint.

# Types of Faults
Fault can be classified in two different ways: Horizontal/Vertical movement of blocks or normal/reverse/thrust (idk man)

### Horizontal/Vertical
| Strike-slip        | Dip-slip         | Oblique-slip                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Horizontal parting | Vertical parting | Both horizontal and vertical parting |

### Normal, Reverse, Thrust
| Normal                      | Reverse                   | Thrust                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Hanging wall goes downwards | Hanging wall goes upwards | Reverse fault at an extreme (almost 45 deg) angle |

# Elements of a Dip-Slip Fault
### Hanging Wall
The block that "hangs" over the other one. ie. the top of it goes over the bottom of the other one.
### Footwall
The one that gets wider on the bottom and thinner at the top than the hanging wall
