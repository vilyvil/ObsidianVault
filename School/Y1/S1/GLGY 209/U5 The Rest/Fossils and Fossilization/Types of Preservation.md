# Recrystallization
When things like shells are converted into more stable minerals, preserving the shells.

The most common form of recrystallization is from Aragonite to Calcite.
 - Both are CaCO3, but have different structures.

# Moldic Preservation
When something is buried in sediment and eventually turned into sedimentary rock.

This typically happens because subterranean fluid dissolves the shell, leaving only the imprint of the shell in the rock.

Two results:
- Mold: Sediment enters inside shell and preserves internal features
- Cast: Sediment outside shell preserves external features

### Moldic Pres.: Replacement
A type of moldic preservation where a new mineral is precipitated into the empty mold.

The most ==frequent== kind of replacement is Pyritization.

# Permineralization
Minerals such as Opal or Chalcedony are precipitated into the pores of a porous dead organism.

This can happen to trees because they have lots of pores

# Carbonization
This happens most frequently for plants, algae, and fish. When fossils are buried very deep in the ground, there's a chance that they turn into pure black carbon.

This happens because, when they are buried, these bodies lose all other elements. This happens due to:
- Bacteria eating organic material
- Subterranean fluids dissolving materials

### Note about exceptionally preserved fossils
Keep in mind that the molecules of these fossils are not preserved. Nothing organic is left.

# Congealment (Exceptional)
**at high latitudes (cold)**

Happens when animals fall into icy swamps. Since it's so cold, there's nothing to cause them to rot.

These swamps can be found in Siberia and the NW Territories.

# Fossilization in Amber (Exceptional)
Amber traps small animals and preserves them for a very long time because of how viscous it is.

# Tar Pits (Exceptional)
Toxic swamps kill whatever falls inside. Since they're so toxic, there's nothing to rot the flesh.
