Fossils are any pieces of evidence of ancient life forms.

# Age
We arbitrarily categorize fossils based on the timing of the last ice age:
- Fossils are older than 11,000 years
- Subfossils are younger than 11,000 years

This system was created to separate Archaeology and Paleontology.

In the very long past, fossils referred to __anything__ that we dug up from the ground.

# Kinds of fossils
Fossils can come in three different types: Body, Trace, and Chemical.

| Body                           | Trace                | Chemical Fossil / Biomarker                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Remains of bones, shells, etc. | Evidence of Activity | Organic compounds created by living being preserved in rock layer |
Body Fossils are most frequent.

# Body Fossils
Body fossils show us the shapes that animals (at least the hard parts) had when they died.

# Trace Fossils
Footprints, tracks, etc. caused by animals and preserved until today.

This can sometimes even happen with flying animals. An example is of looping trails of an insect caught in mud who was trying to fly away.
