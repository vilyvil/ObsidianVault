### "Units" of this course:
1. Generalities about science
	- Exploring how science emerged in history
	- Scientific thinking as a method of understanding reality
	- Comparing and relating science to other human inquiries (art, religion, law)
	- Introducing scientific language
	- How scientific thinking affected the development of geology
2. Planetary Geology
	- Looking at the Earth as a planet
	- Exploring the 
	- Earth's place in the Universe
	- Solar System
	- What are meteorites, asteroids, comets?
	- Solar Nebula Theory (How it explains the formation of the Earth and the Solar System)
 3. Earth's internal structure and chemical composition
	- Methods of investigating Earth's internal structure and composition
	- Internal structure of the Earth according to chemical and physical properties
	- Major chemical elements that compose the Earth

4. Minerals and rocks
	- Principles of ==mineralogy==
	- Major mineral groups on the Earth
	- Types of rocks and their characteristics (which are many)
	- Can connect with Solar Nebula Theory
5. Atmosphere and Hydrosphere
	- 3 different "supersystems":
		- Atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere
	- Work to permanently change the planet
	- Will explore their role in geological processes, such as
		- As media for sediment transport
6. Elements of structural geology
	- Folds, faults, and classifications
	- Observations and seismic investigation as methods of deciphering the Earth's internal structure
7. Vestiges of ancient life forms. Fossils. Trace fossils
	- Major fossil groups and classification
	- Process of fossilization
	- Nature of the fossil record
	- Exceptional fossilization conditions
	- Using the fossil record to explore ancient life despite the loss of information caused by fossilization

8. Time in geology
	- Statigraphy
	- Exploring method and principles to assign order and age to layers and bodies of rocks
	- Major subdivisions of the geological time scale
9. Theory of evolution
	- Emergence of life on Earth 4 billion years ago
	- Exploring major events in the history of life
	- Using modern geology to expand understanding of theory of evolution
10. Paradigm of plate tectonics
	- Definitions and characteristics of plates, continents, and oceans
	- Oceanic rifts, subduction zones, seafloor spreading
	- Wilson Cycle of oceans
	- How plate tectonics affected evolution
