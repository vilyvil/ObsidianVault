The Earth's interior consists of semi-concentric layers. These layers can be categorized in two ways: physical properties and chemical/mineralogical properties.

Usually, the Earth's layers are listed in descending order by depth (core, mantle, crust).

# Layers by ==Chemical== Composition
## Metallic Core
The Earth's core is almost entirely made of ==metals==. Out of the metals, Iron and Nickel are vastly dominant. 
##### <u>Gutenberg Discontinuity</u>
The name of the divide between the metal core and the silicate mantle.
## Silicate Mantle
The mantle is mostly made of silicates, with very ==little diversity== in its mineral composition.
##### <u>Mohorovicic Discontinuity</u>
The name of the divide between the mantle and the crust.
## Silicate Crust
The crust, like the mantle, is mostly silicate, but due to ==frequent collision with interplanetary objects==, as well as effects caused by the ==bio-, atmo-, and hydro- spheres==, there is high mineral diversity.

The Earth's crust varies wildly in thickness. It is thin at the oceans, thicker at the continents, and can get much thicker under some mountain ranges.

# Layers by Physical Properties
### Lithosphere
Solid, outer layer of the Earth. Is the hard ground that we stand on. The lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates which float on the asthenosphere.
### Asthenosphere
Layer of rock so hot that they are semi-molten. Though it is still quite ==viscous==, the ==rock moves like a fluid==. This causes it to have ==convection currents== and causes the ==Earth's tectonic plate movement==.
### Mesosphere
A layer of solid rock which covers a massive volume of the Earth.
### Outer core
Outer layer of the core which is made of liquid metal. We know this layer of the core is liquid because liquid metals ==absorb seismic waves== rather than transmitting them.
### Inner core
Inner layer of the core which is made of "liquid" metal that behaves solid due to insane pressures. Unlike the outer core, ==seismic waves can== travel through the inner core.
