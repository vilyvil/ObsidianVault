# Drilling
We used to have to use drills to collect rocks for direct analysis. This, however, would only take us to a depth of 10 km.

# Seismic Investigation
Now, we can analyze much deeper using seismic waves. The tools we use to measure seismic wave activity are called geophones. Using geophones we can understand the composition of the Earth's interior because seismic waves travel differently through different types of rocks. As these groups of rocks reflect and refract transmitting seismic waves, we can get an idea of their density and shape.

Seismic waves can be induced by human activity through the use of explosives, but they lack the power to produce waves powerful enough to travel to the deepest parts of the Earth.

### Earthquakes
High magnitude earthquakes, however, ==are== capable of creating seismic waves that travel through the entire Earth. Using a massive network of Seismic Observatories all over the world (multiple per country), we can analyze these waves to gain understanding of the deepest depths of the Earth.

Note about ==epicenter== and ==hypocenter==:
Epicenter: The point at the surface above the origin point of the Earthquake
Hypocenter: The origin point of the Earthquake
