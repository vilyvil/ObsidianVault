# Earth as a whole
As a ==whole==, the Earth's most common element is ==Iron. Oxygen and Silicon== follow as the second and third most common elements, since they are the composite elements of silicates.

# Earth's crust
As a result of [[Gravitational Differentiation]], iron is much less common in the Earth's crust. This means that ==Oxygen and Silicon== dominate the crust's composition. Following them is ==aluminum==, which is a very light metal.
