Silicate minerals are formed of large chains/links of tetrahedral silicate units. There are 6 different types of silicate depending on chain structure.

# Nesosilicates (Isolated)
Silicate tetrahedra are linked by cations. There are no covalent bonds present, even between tetrahedra.
- Simple structure makes these very common
### Olivine
==Most frequent mineral on the Earth==, dominates most of the Earth's mantle.
- We know this because:
	- Seismic waves move through the mantle as if they are moving through Olivine.
	- Remnants of ancient eruptions contain lots of Olivine.

### Zircon
On the surface must be found in large bodies of water like ocean or sea.

# Inosilicates (Single Chain)
Silicate tetrahedra have two covalent bonds, on on each side. This causes the formation of long chains. Individual chains form weak ionic bonds between them as a result of mutual attraction to cations between.

This structure makes them very strong when resisting forces that break chains themselves, but very weak when resisting forces that break the chains apart.

It also gives them a distinct shape:

# Sorosilicates (Double Chain)
Single chains have covalent bonds with another single chain. Separate double chains are weakly bonded together by mutual attraction to cations between them.

Rather rare in nature due to the complexity of their structure.

# Phyllosilicates (Sheets)
Continuing the pattern, these are minerals where tons of chains have formed covalent bonds, forming huge sheets of silicate. This makes them quite rare.

Phyllosilicates present high variability in appearance.

### Black & White Mica
Both are rock forming minerals. They are flaky and whole planes of mineral are easily broken off. They both require acidic conditions to form.
They can both form up to 40% of a rock.
The difference is that ==black forms in oceanic crust== and ==white forms in continental crust==.

# Tectosilicates (Framework)
A bunch of sheets covalently bonded to each other. All 4 oxygen atoms of each silicate molecule is covalently bonded with another. No cations are needed in the structure, but they are often present as impurities.

Lots of different types of tectosilicates.

### Quartz
This is the ==most frequent tectosilicate== on Earth. Also the ==most frequent mineral in the Earth's crust==.

Its structure makes it very stable and resistant to dissolution.

# Cyclosilicates
Silicates form ring structures or 3, 4, or 6 tetrahedra. Quite rare due to their strange structure.
