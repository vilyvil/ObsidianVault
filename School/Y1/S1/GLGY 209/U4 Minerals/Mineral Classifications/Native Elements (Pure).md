As the name suggests, the minerals in this classification consist of free, uncombined elements.

There are three subcategories of native elements, like in the periodic table.

# Metals
- Heavy
- Metallic luster (who knew!)
- Opaque
- Soft/Malleable
- Dendrites/wires
# Semimetals
- Poor conductors
- Typically form in lumps

# Nonmetals
- Transparent/Translucent
- No conductivity
- Usually form large, distinct crystals.

##### Silver & Platinum
These two usually form together in small quantities.

##### Arsenic & Antimony (Semimetals)
Form is usually a kidney-shape. Very poisonous.

### Sulphur
Can form large crystals created by bacteria

##### Carbon
Carbon crystals are in diamond form. Usually found at deposits at the end of rivers (aka Alluvial deposit). In North America, they come from glaciers from Northern Canada.
