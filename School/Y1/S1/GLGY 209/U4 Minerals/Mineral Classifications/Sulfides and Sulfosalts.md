These are important because they are good sources of sulfur.

# Sulfides
Minerals formed by a combination between sulfur and one or two metals

### Galena (PbS)
- Allowed us to peer into the mineral crystal structure

### Cinnabarite (HgS)
- Translucent red colour

### Chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂)
- Usually forms large minerals

### Stibinite (Sb₂S₃)
- Acicular
	- Needles protruding radially from a central node

### Pyrite (FeS₂)
- Fools' Gold
- Most common sulfide on Earth
- Usually cubical, sometimes dodecahedron shape (pentagon sides)

### Realgar (AsS) & Orpiment (As₂S₃)
Extremely toxic

# Sulfosalts
Minerals formed by a combination between sulfur, a metal, and a semimetal.

### Stephanite (AgSbS) & Pyrargyrite (AgSbS)
Good sources of silver and antimony
