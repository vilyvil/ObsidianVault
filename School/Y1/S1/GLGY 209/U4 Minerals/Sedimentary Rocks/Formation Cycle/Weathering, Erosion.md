The physical and chemical alteration of rocks by atmospheric influences on the Earth's surface. These atmospheric influences include things like the rain and wind.

# Physical Weathering
Happens when existing rock is broken down due to environmental stresses. In addition to the typical stresses like running water and wind, things like heat cycles can break rocks down to fine particles.

This is evident in the formation process of sand in deserts, which results from the constant heating and cooling of those rocks in the desert, which causes them to crack into smaller and smaller parts.

> Physical weathering does not change the compositions of the minerals it affects.
# Chemical Weathering
Happens when water dissolves ions which react with the rocks it interacts with. The reaction takes off little bits of the rock and ==produces materials of new compositions.==
