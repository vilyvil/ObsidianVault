The process which turns sediment into rocks. This might take place over a few possible processes.

# Compaction
The weight of building sediments causes some sediments to compact together, forming a porous/spongy and fluid-filled material. As compaction continues, these pores become smaller and smaller.

# Cementation
When compaction reaches a certain point, the fluids within the pores will begin to release dissolved minerals. These minerals will react with the rock around them, improving binding between grains. At this point the spongy substance becomes a sedimentary rock.

# Recrystallization
Eventually, the rock may form new crystal mineral grains, turning into a completely different rock.
