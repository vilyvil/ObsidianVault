Many different forms of sediment transport: 

| Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Landslide/Rockfall | Landslides move rocks short distances very quickly and violently.                                                                                                            |
| Aeolian             | Wind carries small particles off in the distance.                                                                                                                            |
| Glacier            | Flowing glaciers embed rocks into themselves and carry them until they melt. Volcanic activity can also send particles into the air, where they are transported by the wind. |
| Stream and River   | Continental water carries particles around                                                                                                                                   |
| Wave and Current   | Oceanic currents/waves carry particles around                                                                                                                                |

# More details on...
## Aeolian Transport
- Can form sand dunes due to the gradual transport of loose particles from one place to another.
- ==Sandstorms== are considered Aeolian transport
- Aeolian transport can cause ==huge clouds of fine particles== visible from very ==high above the ground==.

## Glacier Transport
- Obviously, glacier transport takes thousands of years.

## Water Transport
- River deltas are formed from the mass deposition of sediments. This is why deltas have a weird looking shape. All that land is made from past sediment deposition.
- Rivers often carry bio-clasts since many animals/trees might fall in and die. As a result, ancient deltas are often sources of oil and gas.
- In some cases you might see places where sediments look like they've formed wave-like shapes. This is because the sediments dropped off here were not dropped off constantly, but came in waves as events like storms causing the displacement of lots of sediment.
