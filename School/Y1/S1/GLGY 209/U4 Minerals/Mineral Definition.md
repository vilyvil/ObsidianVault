Minerals are naturally formed chemical substances. They form the smallest units which make up rocks.

Their chemical composition is definite, meaning that chemical composition is important to a mineral's identity, but it is not fixed. Minerals are capable of (and often do) adopting impurities while keeping their identities.

Each mineral also has a characteristic structure. If a mineral has enough impurities present, its structure, and therefore its identity, might change as a result of interference by these impurities.

==When broken into parts, minerals break into smaller chunks of themselves. They cannot be broken into smaller minerals.==

### Organic Minerals
Some minerals can be created by living beings. For example, bacteria sometimes precipitate Sulphur which clumps into minerals. Some animals grow minerals on their backs as shells.

# Mineral Imperfections 
Mineral impurities cause them to have strange shapes and colours. Here are a few examples.
