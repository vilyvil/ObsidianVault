Igneous rocks can be categorized by how large their crystals are.

# Phaneritic
Phaneritic rocks are rocks whose crystals are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. They have distinct textures and appearances, often very spotty with lots of different colors.

Phaneritic rocks are intrusive rocks, and typically take over 10 million years to cool and crystallize. This gave their minerals a lot of time to cool and form large crystals.

### Phaneritic Textures
Analyzing the texture of Phaneritic rocks allows us to peek more deeply into the process of their formation.
##### Granular
Crystals are similarly sized, meaning heat loss among minerals was mostly homogenous during formation.
##### Porphyritic
Some large crystals, but these are surrounded by tons of tiny crystals. This indicates that, during the crystallization process, the magma suddenly moved and caused sudden cooling.
##### Poikilitic
Lots of large crystals surrounded by a huge crystal. This happens when small crystals of a mineral form until that mineral is no longer available. Then, another mineral, which is still left over, begins to form its own crystal and is given a long time to do so, so it forms a huge crystal around the already existing small ones.

# Aphanitic
Small crystals, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. The small size of crystals indicates ==rapid extrusive formation==, taking a few hours to a few days. These rocks typically form from lava flow in volcanoes.

Interestingly, thin sections of aphanitic rocks are transparent.

# Glassy
These rocks have ==no== crystals present, which means that they formed very quickly. Typically they are the result of magma contacting the bottom of oceans, causing solidification within seconds to minutes at most. Glassy rocks are the fastest cooled.

Some glassy rocks will have crystal formations on them, like this Snowflake Obsidian. These crystals formed ==after== the obsidian was created.

# Fragmental
These rocks are formed from fine volcanic ash ejected by a volcanic eruption. Fragmental rocks form in a similar fashion to sedimentary rocks, as the ash must collect and pile up before it forms a rock. As such, fragmental rocks exhibit both igneous and sedimentary properties.
