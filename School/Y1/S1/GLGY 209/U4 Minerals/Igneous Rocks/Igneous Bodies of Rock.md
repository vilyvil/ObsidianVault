# Dike
An almost planar body of igneous rock which pushes a cut out of existing rock.

Dikes are considered ==discordant== because they don't layer themselves with preexisting rock.

# Sill
When magma intrudes between rock layers, forming a sheet of igneous rock between existing rock.

Sills are considered ==concordant== because they form as a layer of the preexisting rock.
