# Volcanic Ash & Tuff
Fine particle matter ejected in volcanic eruptions. Travels over vast regions of the Earth, collecting in sedimentary basins. The rock it forms is called Tuff.
- Tuff has the highest compaction rate of all the rocks we know of.

In some places, we see ==a LOT== of tuff formed from past volcanic explosions. This means that there volcanic eruptions were both more frequent and more powerful in the Earth's past.

# Volcanic Bombs
Large rock fragments of the exploded volcano. These are rarely blasted more than 1 km from their origin.
