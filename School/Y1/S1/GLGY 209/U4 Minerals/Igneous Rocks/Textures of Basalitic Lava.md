# Vesicular/Vacular
This texture of rock, present in basalt, is the most frequent in the solar system. It exhibits a bubbly texture with a lot of holes due to there being a lot of air trapped in the high-viscosity lava.

The air trapped in these rocks helps us peer into the Earth's ancient atmosphere, giving us an idea of:
- Elemental composition
- Isotopes present in the air

# Pillow
"Crystallized" lava flow. Has a very bubbly/bulbous shape. These rocks were formed in volcanic regions of the deep oceans.

Pillow Basalts document past volcanic eruptions which happened at the bottoms of our oceans.
