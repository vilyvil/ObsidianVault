Usually intrusive igneous rocks cool and crystallize in the Earth's crust, but volcanic igneous rocks are further affected by volcanic processes, giving them special form and texture.

There are two types of extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock:
- Formed from lava flow
	- ==Aphanitic Igneous Rocks==
- Formed from pyroclastic flow (volcanic flow which has more gas than rocks)
	- ==Fragmental Igneous Rocks==
