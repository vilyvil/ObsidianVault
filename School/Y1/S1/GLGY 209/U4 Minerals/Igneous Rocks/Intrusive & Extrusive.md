Igneous rocks can be grouped by how they deep they were when they cooled from magma into rock.

# Intrusive
Cooled and crystallized in the Earth's crust

# Extrusive
Cooled and crystallized at the Earth's surface

Intrusive and Extrusive rocks typically have different properties because their environments changed the rate at which they crystallized, which changed the structures which formed inside of them.
