There are two general changes which metamorphic rocks have gone through:
1. Mineralogical
	- Minerals ==recrystallized==, possibly creating new ones.
2. Textural
	- Existing minerals ==rearranged==.

# Why?
Metamorphism happens because rocks exist in equilibrium with their environments.

Therefore, when the environment of a rock changes, the rock itself must change, too.

# Example of Metamorphism
This limestone, instead of being buried deep in the Earth's surface, faced super high temperatures by a passing magma column. This heat caused it to recrystallize.
