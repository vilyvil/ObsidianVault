As temperature and pressure increase, so does the change caused by, or the Grade of, metamorphism increase. As grade increases, strength typically does too.

There are three grades: Low, Medium, and High. As rocks get deeper, metamorphic grade tends to get higher.

# Relation with Rock Cleavage
Slaty rocks are a result of low grade metamorphism.
Phyllitic rocks are a result of medium-low grade metamorphism.
Schistose rocks are a result of medium-high grade metamorphism.
Gneissic rocks are a result of high grade metamorphism.
