# Regional/Barrovian
Very high pressures (such as by plate collision) causes rocks to change.

# Contact/Buchan
Heat dissipated by nearby rising magma causes rocks to change.

# Burial
Thick piles of sediments in basins collect, causing high temperatures AND pressures which causes metamorphism in the basin's depths.
- Temperature and pressure usually have a roughly equal role.
