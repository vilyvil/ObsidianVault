Metamorphic rocks will break along parallel or semi-parallel surfaces as a result of the textural alignment of mineral grains. The different categories are called different cleavages.

There are four types:
# Slaty Cleavage
Happens when preexisting rock is at the beginning of the burial process. At this point, the original rock is still recognizable, and any fossils present have not been destroyed.
- Slates are the most frequent slaty rocks ??

# Phyllitic
Further burial causes parallel appearance to disappear.

# Schistose
Further burial, causing parallel arrangement to reappear.

Additionally, the surfaces of friction between different layers becomes visibly clear.

# Gneissic
Even further burial causes partial melting.

This causes the separation of certain minerals, causing bands to form and begin folding within the rock.
