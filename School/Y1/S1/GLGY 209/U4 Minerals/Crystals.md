Mineral structures are crystal structures. Their atoms form repeating alternating lattice structures.

The smallest repeatable unit of a crystal is called a ==unit cell==.

Crystals do not come in round shapes. They instead have edges, corners, faces.

### Microcrystals
Probably not important, but crystals are made of tons of microcrystals.

# Ideal Crystal Shapes
Here are a few examples of how crystals would pack themselves in ideal conditions (without impurities).

As you can see, they form distinct shapes without curves. The large atoms are entirely surrounded by the small blue atoms, which are surrounded by large atoms themselves.

# An example of how crystal structure affects other properties
Diamonds and graphite. You get it.
