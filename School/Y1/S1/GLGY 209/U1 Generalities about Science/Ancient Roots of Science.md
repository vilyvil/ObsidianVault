# Ancient Roots of Science
- Geological maps have been used ==since ancient times==. They continue to remain significant today because of the information they hold.
- Even tens of thousands of years ago people had precise geological knowledge. However, this knowledge is often lost due to the collapse of civilizations.

### Additionally, ancient scientists studied astronomy. They had: 
 - ==Detailed charts== of the night sky
	 - The night sky could be used as a tool to ==assist navigation== over distances too distant to be seen
	 - This allowed Pacific Islanders to ==travel long distances over sea without getting lost==
- Solar calendars, moon calendars
	- Helped ==keep track== of the changing of ==seasons==
- Ancient Egyptians understood the geology of their area
	- Allowed them to calculate how many ==materials== they had to build projects like the first ==pyramid==

# Greek Rationalism 
(also Romans, who got it from the Greek)
Thought of as the beginning of Modern Science, though still involved the mixture of art, religion, and science. Before this change occurred, Greek philosophers and scholars wrote explanations of the natural world in poems rather than the prose that we expect today.

Around 550 BC. Ancient Greek scholars dismissed mythology as just that, myth. They moved towards rational and natural explanations of the world rather than the supernatural. Experiments were conducted more often and observations recorded, even if such experiments lacked direct applicability. They began to explore science simply to understand more, rather than just to develop technology.

- Ancient Greek scholars were the first to explain the existence of astronomical objects rationally rather than relying on the supernatural.
- First ==models of nature==. Actual attempts to ==understand, explain, and predict== reality.
- Reasoned that storms must be caused by built up energy rather than by gods.
- Came up with ==Geocentric== model of the solar system
- First map of the world
- Formulated idea for ==biogenesis== and the origin of humans

Though this is not pure science as we see it today, the Greeks showed massive improvement in scientific thinking.

This, however, would not last long. Once the Roman Empire collapsed and European science collapsed with the beginning of the [[Fall and Rise in the Dark Ages]].
