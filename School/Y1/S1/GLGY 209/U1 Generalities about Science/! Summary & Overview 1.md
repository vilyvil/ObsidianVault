# Summary
Science is a human inquiry which involves the objective collection of data and observation of natural phenomena and the subsequent formation of hypothesis to explain such phenomena. These hypotheses are reviewed and criticized to oblivion by the scientific community.

Science has existed since ancient times in order to assist navigation, seasonal planning, and material gathering. As Greek and Roman society developed, science expanded as a way to rationally understand why certain things happen. Science challenged religious and mythological explanations of human existence, though scientific ideas would still be intertwined with artistic and religious ideas. Models of nature, such as those concerning our solar system, the creation of life, the evolution of humans, and the formation of storms were formed.

The development of science was furthered in Post-Renaissance Europe, the birthplace of Modern Science. It was in the Royal Society of London in 1660 that science was established as a separate human inquiry and the principles of science were formally established. This time saw massive expansion in science, some of the earliest advances being in geography.

# Overview of Notes
[[Ancient Roots of Science]]
During ancient times, people used science for practical reasons, usually to guide them in undertaking massive projects. A few examples of this include Polynesian peoples using charts of the night sky for navigation, Egyptians using geological knowledge to construct pyramids, etc.
Science came to a peak during the Greek and Roman eras, where science began to separate itself from other human inquiries like religion, the arts, philosophy.

[[Fall and Rise in the Dark Ages]]
When the Roman Empire fell, Europe was plunged into the Dark Ages. Religion took over and science became practically illegal. This would continue with the executions of hundreds of scientists until the beginning of the Rennaissance.

[[Birth of Modern Science]]
After the Renaissance, science only continued to resurge, ballooning with the establishment of ==the Royal Society of London in 1660==. It was then that science became its own distinct inquiry, and things like the Scientific Method and the academic language of today were established.

[[Fundamental Aspects of Science]]
Science is not biased. It does not aim to prove a point, and it should not be approached with the idea that it has a limit. Science aims to understand natural phenomena through logic and reason. Nothing is constant in science; ideas are constantly being criticized.

[[Geology & Subdisciplines]]
Geology is the science of the Earth. It falls into two major categories: the Study of the History of the Earth, and the Study of the Earth's composition. There are many smaller subdisciplines of geology.
