# Further academic development in Europe
As European technology and economy began to develop, so did their academic environment, particularly in Britain and France. Scholars in these areas began to do science without inserting their own interpretations, preferring to extract objective truths.

Example of the development of science: 
Conradus Gesnerus (1516 - 1565) Published a book about fossils which ==described fossils extensively and accurately== and used ==academic language== akin to that of modern academy.
## Novum Organum, Francis Bacon
==Francis Bacon== publishes ==Novum Organum==, which formally outlines and popularizes the scientific method. 

Also emphasizes the practicality of science, showing how scientific advances could help develop industry. This showed how important science was for society and led to the establishment of scientific institutions throughout Europe.

# Royal Society of London
Established ==1660 (REMEMBER THIS!)== during the Restoration after the English Civil War as a result of an ==economical challenge==:
- Manufacturers needed a local source of energy due to a lack of coal in Britain

The establishment of this institution is considered to be the ==birth of Modern Science==. This cemented the ==distinguishing of science== from other human inquiries such as art, religion, philosophy, etc. ==Experimental data== became the basis of science.

The establishment of this Society led to the expansion of the Natural Sciences and our understanding of the history of nature. 
This includes: 
- ==Nicolaus Steno's== creation of the first principles of geological layer formation
- ==Thomas Burnet's== publishing of "The Sacred Theory of the Earth" in 1681, which described the formation of the Earth as the mixing and floating together of a chaotic mass of particles.
