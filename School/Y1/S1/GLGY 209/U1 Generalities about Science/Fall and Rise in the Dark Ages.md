During this time, Europe was plunged into "Hell". Lifespan dropped to 20-30 years.
Science was ==no longer valued==. Those who ==questioned== the beliefs of religion were ==punished severely==.

The Arab World, however, reached a new peak of knowledge which they shared with the Europeans.

As European curiosity began its resurgence came the Renaissance, beginning in France. (cuz the arabs don't matter I guess)

# New and revolutionary discoveries in Europe
- ==Copernicus== (1543) publishes "de revolutionibus orbium coelestium"
	- Introduces ==heliocentric model== of the universe, challenging the old geocentric model.
	- Post-mortem publication because of risk that he would be punished for questioning geocentricism.
- ==Galileo== (1610)
	- Using ==primitive telescope==, recorded revolutionary ==observations== on Jupiter's satellites, the Moon, etc.
		- Observed mountains, depressions on the Moon's surface
		- Discovered Jupiter's 4 largest moons
		- First person to observe the rings of Saturn up close
- Johannes ==Kepler==
	- Correctly predicted planetary orbit around the Sun using ==his laws==
	- Wanted to prove that there was a "God-mathematician" controlling the universe
	- Retracted this after realizing that planetary orbits traced the ==shapes of ellipses== rather than perfect circles or polygons

This development would eventually balloon into the [[Birth of Modern Science]].
