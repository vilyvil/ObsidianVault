Science is the permanent challenge involving the objective observation and investigation of natural phenomena. Scientific data can come only from experiments and direct observations. Scientific conclusions must not be influenced by other human inquiries.
# Scientific Approach
- Science is based on trial and error
- Data obtained through laboratory experiments and observations. Data checked and peer-reviewed before publication.
- Hypothesis drawn from data are checked and challenged until they may become Theory.
# Theory and Paradigm
As a hypothesis becomes widely accepted as a robust explanation of some phenomena, it may become a Theory, though rarely. Furthermore, some hypothesis may become Paradigms, which broadly explain large-scale phenomena, such as the Expansion of the Universe (not really sure about this part). Theories and Paradigms will change over time as a science is explored in more depth.

# Characteristics of Science
- Nothing in science is absolute. All conclusions must be constantly challenged and verified as science develops.
- Science is developed through ==investigation and debate==, not trying to convince others.
- Predetermined notions must not influence science.
- We must not assume that science is limited.

## Scientific Language
Sciences use words in peculiar ways separate from their meaning in every-day language. This turns every day words into terminology, which can be confusing for non-scientists.

For example, the word Theory in every day life implies a bit of uncertainty, but in science Theories are much more rigorous than an every day theory. Nevertheless, theories are still not absolute.
