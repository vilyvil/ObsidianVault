We will look at the question:
"do you really accept utilitarianism's way of looking at the question?"

Smart's system is consequentialist and its consequentialism is both
eudaimonistic and direct. - It's specially concerned with happiness

Eudaimonistic - Actions should increase or maximize happiness.
 Utility = Amt of happiness created
  Happiness = When one gets what they want or prefer

Direct - Concern of morality being attached directly to specific actions
rather than to rules or practices

Not everything that has value has it because of its consequences. Otherwise, one would just go on for ever, and there would be an obviously hopeless regress.

Things that have value without it being based on consequences have *intrinsic* value. Consequentialism's central idea is that the only thing with intrinsic value is states of affairs.

In consequentialism the value of actions comes from producing valuable states of affairs, not their intrinsic value.
But surely some actions have intrinsic value? Because to say that doing something makes someone happy is to say that they like doing them for their own sake. It doesn't necessarily mean that those actions induce feelings of happiness in them. 


Author argues that Right Action is only based on maximizing happiness, and therefore it doesn't matter if someone did the best they could with their current knowledge, if they didn't do exactly the right thing as they would with perfect knowledge then they didn't do the right thing.

If we restrict right action to the ones available to a person, then what does available really mean? Does it mean only actions that could have occurred to him? So everyone should be excused for negligence?

Not all good states of affairs are created as effects of actions, they might be created by the agent doing an act. 

Important difference between a situation being right for a consequentialist and a non-consequentialist
For the first, an act is right because it creates a good situation out of it.
For the second, a situation is good because the right action was taken.

There are sometimes actions which would be considered the right thing for a person to do, but wouldn't create the best possible state of affairs. For example, a person should keep promises. If someone keeps a promise, then they did the right thing, but then, if we assume that for some reason the person keeping their promise causes several other people to NOT keep their promises, then in consequentialisms' view the person actually SHOULDN'T HAVE kept their promise.
