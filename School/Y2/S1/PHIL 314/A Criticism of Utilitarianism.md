We will look at the question:
"do you really accept utilitarianism's way of looking at the question?"

Smart's system is consequentialist and its consequentialism is both
eudaimonistic and direct. - It's specially concerned with happiness

Eudaimonistic - Actions should increase or maximize happiness.
 Utility = Amt of happiness created
  Happiness = When one gets what they want or prefer

Direct - Concern of morality being attached directly to specific actions
rather than to rules or practices
