We will look at the question:
"do you really accept utilitarianism's way of looking at the question?"

Smart's system is consequentialist and its consequentialism is both
eudaimonistic and direct. - It's specially concerned with happiness

Eudaimonistic - Actions should increase or maximize happiness.
 Utility = Amt of happiness created
  Happiness = When one gets what they want or prefer

Direct - Concern of morality being attached directly to specific actions
rather than to rules or practices

Not everything that has value has it because of its consequences. Otherwise, one would just go on for ever, and there would be an obviously hopeless regress.

Things that have value without it being based on consequences have *intrinsic* value. Consequentialism's central idea is that the only thing with intrinsic value is states of affairs.

In consequentialism the value of actions comes from producing valuable states of affairs, not their intrinsic value.
But surely some actions have intrinsic value? Because to say that doing something makes someone happy is to say that they like doing them for their own sake. It doesn't necessarily mean that those actions induce feelings of happiness in them. 


Author argues that Right Action is only based on maximizing happiness, and therefore it doesn't matter if someone did the best they could with their current knowledge, if they didn't do exactly the right thing as they would with perfect knowledge then they didn't do the right thing.

If we restrict right action to the ones available to a person, then what does available really mean? Does it mean only actions that could have occurred to him? So everyone should be excused for negligence?

Not all good states of affairs are created as effects of actions, they might be created by the agent doing an act. 

Important difference between a situation being right for a consequentialist and a non-consequentialist
For the first, an act is right because it creates a good situation out of it.
For the second, a situation is good because the right action was taken.

There are sometimes actions which would be considered the right thing for a person to do, but wouldn't create the best possible state of affairs. For example, a person should keep promises. If someone keeps a promise, then they did the right thing, but then, if we assume that for some reason the person keeping their promise causes several other people to NOT keep their promises, then in consequentialisms' view the person actually SHOULDN'T HAVE kept their promise.

Morally unthinkable. Situations where a person simply could not think of making a decision because that would be insane, but consequentialism forces you to. Like choosing between massacring seven million and massacring seven million and one.

There are situations where the one's action has a remote relation to a caused situation, and that can be difficult to think about, but we won't be focusing on that. Instead we'll be focusing on situations where one's action caused someone else to do something, because for consequentialism it won't matter if the situation was directly caused by me or not, the fact that I caused it is the important part.

Negative responsibility - One is just as responsible for the things that they fail to bring about as the things they do bring about.

Also, it doesn't matter if a situation is partly caused by other agents, the only thing that matters is  the outcome.

Something that utilitarianism cuts out is the idea that we are especially responsible for the actions we do rather than the ones others do. The author calls this integrity. Some might argue that it won't be necessary that we reject utilitarianism even if utilitarianism cuts out integrity, but the author says it is, and the reason why utilitarianism cuts out integrity is because it "cannot coherently describe the relations between a man's projects and his actions."

Utilitarianism alienates one from their moral identity and therefore their integrity. The author says that pains or discomforts about the utilitarian course of action should be entirely discounted because they are irrational.
"If, then, one is really going to regard oneâ€™s feelings from a strictly utilitarian point of view, Jim should give very little weight at all to his; it seems almost indecent, in fact, once one has taken that point of view, to suppose that he should give any at all."

Author then makes argument that utilitarianism might favour getting rid of a minority if their presence makes a huge majority unhappy enough. If the minority found this idea unsettling, then actually their discomforts should be discounted too because they are irrational. After all, it would be better for the greater good to get rid of them. If a utilitarian finds this proposition unsettling, then if he were a thorough utilitarian he should rid himself of these feelings, since he should only be thinking logically in order to maximize happiness. Then, it seems reasonable to take other moral thoughts similar to that and discount them too.

The psychological effect of taking the best action should be discounted because it is irrational.
Precedent: Doing something will encourage others to do it, even if it really wouldn't be. 

In both Jim (asked to kill one protester in exchange for lives of the rest) and George's (asked to work for chemical warfare) situation, if the protag doesn't do some disagreeable thing, then someone else will, and it will be worse. 

"What one does is not included in the outcomes of what one does, but what another does can be in included in the outcome of what one does."

However, it is misleading to say that Jim's actions had the effect of Pedro killing the protestors, since Pedro wasn't actually left with no alternative actions. Doing so would leave Pedro out of the picture. To criticize negative responsibility, we will think of Jim's situation as the effects of Pedro's project (of killing all the protestors if Jim doesn't kill one) on Jim's decision.

Side note: how far should someone be expected to calculate the benefits of their actions anyway?

Now we will suppose that pursuing projects makes someone happy. It could not possibly be true that those projects are themselves projects of pursuing happiness (Psych Hedonism, remember?). One has to be content with other things for there to be anywhere for happiness to come from.

Commitments = Covers a vast range of projects that make people happy.

A utilitarian would say that, in a situation where someone's actions conflict with your actions, and theirs would create greater satisfaction, you should stop your own actions. But consider the case where your action is a commitment, which you've been building your whole life. How are you supposed to see your commitment as disposable and just throw it away just because someone else has come along and made the situation so that you must throw it away? The point isn't that he's going to lose happiness if he decides to be utilitarian about it. It's that he's just going to throw away a piece of himself that he's been working on forever. This is an attack on his integrity.

Many of the qualities people prefer in human beings that make them happy are not utilitarian, but they still make us happy. It is not clear to the author how utilitarian deals with that.

Gresham's Law Problem: Like the prisoner's dilemma: Worst case overall happens when two people don't work together, worst case (individually) happens to an individual if he decides to cooperate and the other doesn't, and the best case overall happens if they both work together. Now imagine a utilitarian and a non-utilitarian in this case, where the non-utilitarian decides not to work with the utilitarian, and the utilitarian knows this. Now, for the utilitarian the only rational choice is for him to choose not to work together and thus choose the worst overall case for society.

Of course, such conflicts irl could be mitigated by the state, but this kind of thing can happen within states as well.

A utilitarian might give two arguments:
1. It's not just a utilitarian thing to talk about how to avoid conflict.
	- But this is missing the point, which is talking about a state of the world where not everyone is utilitarian. In that case, utilitarians are SUPPOSED to increase conflict.
2. This argument the author gave is utilitarian?
	 - Author replies saying that the ultimate fate of utilitarianism is to usher itself out because its way of deciding questions could lead to disaster in some cases.
		 - Utilitarianists themselves recognize this and left the way open for utilitarianism to fall to a more indirect level of total assessment (?). But once that's begun it will begin to fade away until its only demand is that the world be run in the best way possible with no demand on how that is done.

As a result, for maximal utility in the world it might be the case that very few people accept utilitarianism, in which case it's useless.

Now, in the case where the government is utilitarian and the people are not, the government would have to act in ways that the populace does not agree with, which means that the government is not entirely beholden to the people. This arrangement is very manipulative, and is only safe as long as the people running the government don't realize that. However, it's extremely likely that they WOULD realize that and start abusing their power.

Social Choice
Will go through a journey where doubts cause changes which cause utilitarianism to fade away. Three steps:
1. Recognizing that it's possible to use social decision functions which are not utilitarian, using utilitarian-type comparisons of utilities
2. Casting doubt on the adequacy of utilities, perceived satisfactions, and expressed preferences as the basis of social decision, and then entertaining conceptions of welfare and happiness which raise more pervasive problems about interpersonal comparison and aggregation
3. Finally having doubts about using such an ambitious and totalistic social system for more than very specific and limited purposes.
