# Pro Arguments
1. Weak. Since many people have different ideas on morality, there's no way for an absolute standard exists.
	- This is weak because it doesn't matter if people's opinions on morality differ or not. An absolute standard could simply exist without them knowing it.
2. Stronger. If there is an absolute standard, then there is no way for it to exist. Sure, you could base it on your religion and say that the standard was determined by your God. But this isn't enough for us. If we do this, then we'll just be blindly believing in some random thing. Is that really enough for a philosopher?

# Against Arguments
1. If there is no absolute standard for morality, then it is not possible to compare different people, ages, nations, etc. based on their morality.
	 - The author argues that comparison only feels natural for us
	 - Without comparison, you cannot talk about moral progress. So, what are we fighting to make society better for?
	 - Without comparison, you cannot even blame someone for a crime. What if a criminal claims he just has his own moral standard? If he was following his moral standard then how was he wrong commit the crime that he did?
	 - How can we even know what moral standards belong to what group? Do group members even know among themselves? What if their opinions differ? What if one person decides to better their society by going against their moral standards? Are they being immoral?
	 - If moral standards are all equal, then why do we even bother with them? Why not just go with an easier standard and live an easier life.
