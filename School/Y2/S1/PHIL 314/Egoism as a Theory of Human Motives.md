Pluralism of Ultimate Desires - Different kinds of ultimate desire
Monism of Ultimate Desires - Only one ultimate desire, and all desires come from this ultimate desire.

All kinds of ultimate desire are egoistic.

There might be many senses of the word egoistic. Some desires can be egoistic in one sense and some in another. 

**Psychological Egoism**: All kinds of ultimate desire are egoistic. I.e people are always motivated by self-interest. This theory is not necessarily monistic.
**Psychological Hedonism**: All human action is motivated by the desire to get or prolong pleasant experiences and to avoid or cut short unpleasant experiences. This theory is monistic.

If psychological egoism is false, then psychological hedonism is false. However, it's not necessarily the case that if psych. egoism is true then psych. hedonism is true.

# Motives

Author lists a bunch of desires everyone has:
1. Desire for self-preservation
2. Desire for one's own happiness (get pleasant, cut short unpleasant)
3. Desire to be a self of a certain kind (to get, keep, develop certain mental/bodily powers and avoid others)
4. Desire for self-respect (feel certain emotions towards oneself and not feel others)
5. Desire to get and keep property
6. Desire for self-assertion (get and exercise power over others and make them do things)
7. Desire for self-display (get others to feel things about them; fear, love, respect, etc.)

# Motivestimulants
Desires which are primarily concerned with other things or people and would either not exist at all 
or be much weaker if not for already existing relations with you. **These desires are called egoistic motivestimulants**

Most important (according to author) are:
1. Relation of ownership.
2. Blood-relationship.
3. Relations of love and friendship.
4. Relationship to fellows of an institution.

For all of these you would feel a stronger obligation to do something for the people or things in question than you would otherwise.

# Classifications of Motives & Motivestimulants
### Self-Confined
The ones that could still exist even if a person was the only thing in the universe. No family, no love, no fellows, no display, no assertion, no property, etc.
- Desire for self-preservation
- Desire for one's own happiness
- Desire to be a self of a certain kind
- Desire for self-respect

### Extraverted
Any desire which is not self-confined

### Introverted
Desires that are egoistic are introverted (this is literally all of the ones he listed). A self-confined desire is purely introverted, whereas egoistic but not self-confined desires are both.

### Self-Centred
Desires which are not self-confined, but where the person is mainly concerned with themselves, and the other thing they're concerned with is only an object of their acts or just the other term in a relationship with them.

Desires for property, self-assertion, self-display, and for affection.
### Self-Regarding
Desires that are self-confined or self-centred

### Other-Regarding
A desire which is both introverted and extra-verted (In other words, not self-confined) and where the primary emphasis is on the other person/thing and its states. Here the relationship of that other thing is a strong motive-stimulant, but one's desire is that it will be in a certain state.

### Self-Referential
Desires which are other-regarding but involve an egoistic motive-stimulant.

Ex. When a mother wants to care for her children but not those of others, she's expressing an *other-regarding* desire based on her egoistic motive-stimulant (in this case blood relationship to her babies).

# Interrelations
### Self-Preservation & Happiness
Self-preservation is typically a necessary one's own happiness, since one can't be happy if they're dead. You might think that self-preservation is subordinate to happiness, but it is possible for someone to want self-preservation without knowing whether the rest of their life will be happy.

### Property+Power & Self-Pres+Happiness
Obviously property and power can be desired as a way to get self-preservation and happiness. So, property+power could be subordinate to the desires for self-pres and happiness, but they are also often independent. It's obvious that people often desire property and power without any reason behind it, and that they will sacrifice happiness, security, and even life to do so.

Someone might argue that people just want property and power because they enjoy the experience of getting it, and so they want to keep getting that pleasant experience. The author claims that this makes no sense. The author claims that the experience is only pleasant when the person desires power or property. However, this is impossible since the ultimate desire is for pleasant experiences themselves, not for power or property. Since one cannot desire for power or property by themselves (as the author says) then one can't find pleasure from getting power or property.

This is the same for desires of self-respect and self-display. If one already desires to feel certain emotions or to be the object of certain emotions in others, then that means they find pleasant those experiences. But since that requires a pre-existing desire to the pleasant experience, this is not possible.

## Egoistic Desires Mix
For example, consider a woman who wants her child to be happy, successful, loved.
THE AUTHOR SAYS that other motives could be mixed in with this too. Like, she might other women to be envious of her child's greatness (self-display), or, she doesn't want to be burdened by a problem child (one's own happiness).

Of course, we can't explain away the actions of many mothers with only self-centred/self-contained desires.

# Various Forms of Psychological Egoism
## All motives egoistic, all motives of one ultimate kind
Generally people have said that desire is the desire for one's own happiness. This theory says that the only ultimate motives are self-confined and the only ultimate self-confined motive is the desire one's own happiness.

This is false. Self-preservation isn't entirely for one's own happiness. There are non self-confined motives (power over others, affection, etc.). There are motives that are self-referential but primarily other-regarding.

## Only form worth discussing
All ultimate motives are either self-confined, self-centered, or other-regarding but self-referential.

Now we will go over some examples
### Case A
Think of a person who does not expect to experience anything after their death, who writes a will that nobody will know about during their lifetime.

1. This person can't possibly be doing this because they wants some kind of experience (from the will being carried out) after they're dead. They don't fucking believe that'll happen.
2. One might say that his motive is to enjoy (while alive) the pleasant experience of imagining others' gratitude for his will. This is valid, but it can't be the main reason since his enjoyment of this experience would be his **underlying desire to be thought of in one way or another**.
3. His ultimate motive can't be desire for his own happiness.
4. His motive could be for self-display, that others related to him will think of him a certain way after his death. In this case, his motives are other-regarding and can all be self-referential.

The motives of such a person are either self-regarding or self-referential, but you can't say all of them are self-confined or that none are other-regarding.

### Case B
Consider a man who subscribes anonymously to a certain charity.

1. Can't be for self-display
2. He could just want to enjoy the self-approval and seeing an institution he likes doing well, but that can't be his primary desire (since that means he desires self-approval or desires seeing institution doing well)
3. Because of 2, we see that some of his motives must be other-regarding, and it is possible that they are self-referential.

The question that remains is this: Can someone's motives be non-egoistic? After these two cases, this question comes down to the question: Is it possible to believe a person's motives are other-regarding but not self-referential?

### Case C
Consider someone who chooses to devote his working life to working with people with leprosy, despite knowing that he'll almost certainly die to leprosy in the process.

Further suppose that he is a Roman Catholic Priest who believes that his actions may
1. Secure him a place in heaven
2. Give him a reputation for heroism in this world
3. Give his church good credit

There is no doubt, in this case, that he has an other-regarding motive to alleviate the suffering of those with leprosy. However, there are other questions:
1. Is this other-regarding motive stimulated by an egoistic motive-stimulus and therefore self-referential?
2. Assume that this motive was not supported by the other self-regarding and self-referential motives. Would it be enough (against the motives to not do so) to ensure that the choice was actually made?

As for question 1, the priest probably isn't related to the people with leprosy in any way because they're ASIAN?? (I'm assuming leprosy was only in Asia?)

As for the second question, you can't really prove in either way. You can't prove that someone without those 3 priest motives would have wanted to do it, but you also can't prove that they absolutely wouldn't do it without those motives.

The author suspects a psychological egoist might counter by saying that the priest did this leprosy thing in order to relieve himself of the unpleasant experience of imagining these people suffering from leprosy. The author has two remarks:
1. This motive can't have been primary, and can't have been the only motive. Unless this person desired just that leprosy ridden people are cured of leprosy, there is no reason why by itself the thought of these people is unpleasant. This pleasure first requires the desire for well-being of others.
2. Why tf would he GO there to relieve himself of unpleasant imaginations to SEE THEM FOR HIMSELF??? Anyways, as a priest he'd probably not want to relieve himself of those thoughts anyway. He'd keep them in mind as motivation to do what he does.

It is important to note that even if one imagines themselves of their loved ones in a situation in order to feel sympathetic about someone else's suffering, this does not make that desire to help/relieve that pain self-referential. It only helps them understand the pain. Whether or not they give a single fuck is still up to them and their desires.

# Summary
1. If Psychological Egoism asserts that all ultimate motives are self-confined or all self-confined or self-centred, or all self-confined can be reduced for desire for one's happiness, it is straight up wrong.
2. It gets closer if it asserts that all ultimate desires are either self-regarding, self-referential, or other-regarding but require a self-referential stimulus, but not entirely there. 
3. Psychological Egoism is not very strong if it's meant to apply universally. Sometimes people are strongly influenced by other-regrading motives even if there is no self-referential stimulus.
