# Useful Example

a) We write that f(n) = O(g(n)) as long as there is some n value n0 and value c such that for all n values right of n0, cg(n) >= f(n)

b) We write that f(n) = Ω(g(n)) as long as there is some n value n0 and value c such that for all n values right of n0, cg(n) <= f(n)

c) We write that f(n) = Θ(g(n)) as long as there is some n value n0, values c1 and c2 such that for all n values right of n0, c<sub>1</sub>g(n) <= f(n) <= c<sub>2</sub>g(n)
# O-notation
We use O-notation to give an upper bound to a function to within a constant factor.
