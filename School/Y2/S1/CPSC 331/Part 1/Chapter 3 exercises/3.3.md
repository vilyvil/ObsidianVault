Suppose that f(n) and g(n) are monotonically increasing functions. Then for two values m and n where m < n, f(m) < f(n) and the same for g(n).
m < n
f(m) < f(n)
g(m) < g(n)

If we add these inequalities to one another, we get
For two values m and n where m < n, f(m) + g(m) < f(n) + g(n).

We know that if m < n then g(m) < g(n). Since g(m) < g(n), we can input them into f(n) knowing that f(g(m)) < f(g(n)).

For two values m and n where m < n, f(g(m)) < f(g(n))

If we additionally assume that fn and gn are nonnegative, we can combine the original inequalities by multiplying them together to get:
f(m) \* g(m) < f(n) \* g(n)
