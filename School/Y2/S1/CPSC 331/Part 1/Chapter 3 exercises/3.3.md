Suppose that f(n) and g(n) are monotonically increasing functions. Then for two values m and n where m < n, f(m) < f(n) and the same for g(n).
m < n
f(m) < f(n)
g(m) < g(n)

If we add these inequalities to one another, we get
For two values m and n where m < n, f(m) + g(m) < f(n) + g(n).

We know that if m < n then g(m) < g(n). Since g(m) < g(n), we can input them into f(n) knowing that f(g(m)) < f(g(n)).

For two values m and n where m < n, f(g(m)) < f(g(n))

If we additionally assume that fn and gn are nonnegative, we can combine the original inequalities by multiplying them together to get:
f(m) \* g(m) < f(n) \* g(n)

2. n0 = 4c
n >= n0 = 4c
n >= 4c

0 <= c2^n < n!

n terms of 2 + 1 term of c  | n terms
c * 2 * 2 * ... * 2 < n * (n - 1) * ... * 2 * 1

n - 2 terms of 2 + 4c
4c * 2 * 2 * ... * 2 < 4c * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 2 * 1

n - 2 terms       n - 2 terms, all greater than 2.
2 * 2 * ... * 2 < (n - 1) * ... * 2

Therefore the inequality is true.
