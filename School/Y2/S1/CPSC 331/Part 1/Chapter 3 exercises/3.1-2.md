Upper Bound
Selection sort does (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1 operations in the worst case.
This is because in the worst case the array is in reverse order, so
on the first iteration the alg must go through n - 1 comparisons to find
the smallest, then n - 2 on the second to find the second smallest, etc.

That expression roughly equals
n(n - 1)/2 if you add the largest term with the smallest term to get n,
add the second largest with the second smallest to get n, etc. Until
you get (n - 1)/2 terms of n. 

n(n - 1)/2 is roughly n^2, so you get O(n^2).

Then for Î© time you can do the same logic as insertion sort
