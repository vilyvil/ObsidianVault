Sort the array with merge sort, which takes n * lgn time in the worst case.

Then, for every key in the array, calculate the value such that key + value = x. Then do a binary search in the array for value. The array should run at most n - 1 times. Everything inside the array except for binary search takes constant time to run. Binary search takes lgn time in the worst case.
