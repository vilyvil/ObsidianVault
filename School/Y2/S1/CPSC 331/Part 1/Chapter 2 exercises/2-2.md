a. That A' is a permutation of A
b. 
Every iteration of the inner for loop, A\[j] is the smallest value in A\[j : n].

Initialization
At the beginning of the loop j = n, so A\[j : n] is just A\[n]. Since A\[n] is the only value in the subarray, it is the smallest value in the subarray.

Maintenance
Assume that just before an iteration, A\[j] is the smallest element of A\[j : n]. When we add A\[j - 1] to the subarray during the iteration, two things can happen. If A\[j - 1] is greater than A\[j], then A\[j - 1] and A\[j] swap places, and A\[j - 1] now still holds the smallest element of A\[j - 1 : n]. If A\[j - 1] is greater than A\[j] then A\[j - 1] is still the smallest element of A\[j - 1 : n].

Decrementing j then preserves the loop invariant.

Termination
Since the loop is a for loop, it always terminates once j has iterated down to i. As a result, A\[i] is the smallest element of subarray A\[i : n].

c.
Every iteration of the outer for loop, A\[1 : i - 1] is sorted and contains the i - 1 smallest elements of A.

Initialization
When the loop initializes, i = 1, so A\[1: i - 1] is empty and therefore sorted.

Maintenance
Assume that A\[1 : i - 1] is sorted and contains the i - 1 smallest elements of A before an iteration of the loop.

During this iteration of the loop, the inner for loop has this termination condition: A\[i] is the smallest element of subarray A\[i : n]. Since A\[1 : i - 1] already contained the i - 1 smallest elements of A, A\[i] must be greater than all the elements of A\[1 : i - 1]. As a result, when i is incremented, A\[1 : i - 1] is still sorted and still contains the i - 1 smallest elements of A.

Termination
When the loop terminates, i = n, so the subarray A\[1 : i - 1] is actually A\[1 : n - 1] and contains the n - 1 smallest elements in A in sorted order. As a result, A\[n] must be greater than all of the elements in A\[1 : n - 1] and A\[1 : n] is also sorted.
