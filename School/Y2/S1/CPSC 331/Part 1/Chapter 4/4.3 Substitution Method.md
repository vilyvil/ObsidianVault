Most general method in Chapter 4.

Two steps:
1. Guess the form of the solution using symbolic constants
2. Use mathematical induction to show that the solution works, and find the constants.
To apply the inductive hypothesis of induction, you substitute the guessed solution for the function on smaller values.

Can be used to establish an upper or lower bound on a recurrence. It's best not to do them both at the same time. Do them one by one. 

# Example
T(n) = 2T(floor(n/2)) + theta(n)

This is similar to the one for merge sort except for the floor. Let's assume that the upper bound is the same as merge sort: nlgn.

##### Inductive Hypothesis
T(n) < cnlgn for all n > n0, where we choose c and n0 later. We can't assume with the inductive hypothesis that T(n) = O(nlgn) because it's be dangerous - we'll talk about it later.

##### Inductive Step
Assume that the above bound holds for all numbers at least as big as n0 and less than n. Therefore, if n >= 2 * n0, it holds for n/2, giving us

If we substitute the right hand side into our recurrence, we get:

where the last step holds if we constrain n0 and c such that for n >= 2 * n0, cn dominates the unknown function represented by theta(n).

###### Base Case
We want to show

As long as n0 > 1, we have lgn > 0, which implies that nlgn > 0. Let's pick n0 = 2. Since the base cases of T(n) are not listed, we assume it's algorithmic, meaning T(2) and T(3) are constant (textbook says they should be if they describe the worst-case running time of any real program on inputs of size 2 or 3). Picking c = max{T(2), T(3)} gives us T(2) <= c < (2lg2)c and T(3) <= c < (3lg3)c, giving the inductive hypothesis for the base cases.

Usually people don't do their proofs this thoroughly, especially the base cases. This is because ~~Tony Stark learns from his mistakes~~ divide and conquer recurrences usually handle base cases the same. Ground the induction on a range of values from a convenient positive constant n0 up to some constant n'0 > n0 such that for n >= n'0, the recurrence always bottoms out on a constant sized base case between n0 and n'0 (in this example n'0 = 2n0). Then, it's usually apparent, without spelling out the details, that with a suitably large choice of the leading constant (c in this example) the inductive hypothesis can be made to hold for all values in the range from n0 to n'0
