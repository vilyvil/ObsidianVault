These recurrences take the form

where k is a positive integer; all constants a1, a2, ..., ak are in the reals and strictly positive; all the constants b1, b2, ... bi, are in the reals and strictly greater than 1l and the driving function is defined on sufficiently large nonnegative reals and is itself nonnegative.

Akra-Bazzi recurrences generalize the class of recurrences addressed by the master theorem. Akra-Bazzi recurrences can describe the running timeof divide-and-conquer algorithms that break a problem into different-sized sub-problems. However you can't ignore floors and ceils. There are extra requirements.

The difficulty with dealing with floors and ceils is that driving functions can be really, really weird. Fortunately, most of the driving functions we see behave nicely so we don't need to worry, but we do for Akra-Bazzi recurrences.

# Polynomial-Growth Condition

To a first order (whatever tf that means), it means that f(theta(n)) = theta(f(n)), although the condition is a bit stronger than that, and f(n) is asymptotically positive. 

Examples of functions that satisfy the polynomial growth condition include any function of the form

Most of the polynomially bounded functions in this book satisfy the condition. Exponentials and superexponentials do not, and there also exist polynomially bounded functions that do not.

# Floors and Ceils in "nice" recurrences
When the poly condition is satisfied, floors and ceils don't change the asymptotic behaviour of the solution. This is formalized in the following theorem.
