Solves recurrences of the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n),
where a > 0 and b > 1 are constants. f(n) is called a driving function. A recurrence of this form is called a master recurrence.

Master method allows you to state a master recurrence without floors and ceils. The bounds stay the same. 
# Master Theorem
Let a > 0 and b > 1 be constants, and let f(n) be the driving function that is defined and non-negative on all sufficiently large reals. Define the recurrence T(n) on n ∈ ℕ by
T(n) = aT(n/b) + F(n),

Then the asymptotic behaviour of T(n) can be characterized as follows:

The function
![[Pasted image 20240923095534.png]]
is called the watershed function. In each of the three cases, we compare the driving function f(n) to the watershed function. If the watershed function grows faster than the driving function, then case 1 applies. If they grow the same then case 2, if the driving function grows faster than case 3.
But the technical details matter.

In case 1, the watershed function actually has to grow polynomially faster than the driving function by a factor of theta($n^ϵ$) where ϵ > 0. The cost per level grows geometrically from root to leaves, and the total cost of the leaves dominates the total cost of internal nodes.

In case 2, the watershed function and driving function grow at nearly the same rate, but the driving function grows faster by a factor of theta($lg^kn$), where k >= 0. Then we tack on an extra lgn factor to T(n), giving![[Pasted image 20240923100201.png]]
In case 2, each level of the recursion tree is approximately the same - ![[Pasted image 20240923100438.png]]
and there are ![[Pasted image 20240923100448.png]] levels.

In case 3, the driving function has to grow polynomially faster than the watershed function, mirroring case 1. Additionally the driving function has to satisfy the regularity condition that
![[Pasted image 20240923100313.png]]. This condition is satisfied by most polynomially bounded functions that you're likely to encounter. It might not be satisfied if the driving function grows slowly in local areas, yet relatively quickly overall. The cost per level drops at least geometrically from root to leaves, and the root cost dominates the cost of all other nodes.

The polynomial separation between driving and watershed functions doesn't have to be much. For example, taking ![[Pasted image 20240923100646.png]], the watershed function is $n^2$. The driving function is smaller by a factor of $n^{0.01}$.

# Using the Master Method
Consider ![[Pasted image 20240923100843.png]]. the watershed function is therefore $n^2$ = theta($n^2$), and since our driving function is n = O($n^{2-ϵ}$), for any constant epsilon >= 1, we can apply case 1 of the theorem to get T(n) = theta($n^2$).
Now consider ![[Pasted image 20240923101111.png]], where a = 1 and b = 3/2, so the watershed function is ![[Pasted image 20240923101143.png]]. Case 2 applies because the driving function is 1 = theta($n^{lob_ba}lg^0n$) = theta(1). The solution to the recurrence is T(n) = theta(lgn).

# When Master Method doesn't apply
Sometimes the watershed and driving functions can't be compared. We might have that the driving function is much larger than the watershed for an infinite number of values of n but also that the driving function is much smaller than the watershed for an infinite number of different values of n.

However even if you can compare the growth of watershed and driving function there are gaps. There is a gap between case 1 and 2 when ![[Pasted image 20240923101953.png]], yet the watershed does not grow polynomially faster than the driving function. Similarly, there is a gap between case 2 and 3 when ![[Pasted image 20240923102032.png]] and the driving function grows more than polylogarithmically faster than the watershed, but does not grow polynomially faster.
