Runs in Θ($n^{lg(7)}$) time, lower than Θ($n^3$). The key is to use the divide and conquer idea but with less leaves. Strassen's algorithm only performs 7 recursive calls at the cost of constant higher cost per call, but it pays off. It does this by adding more additions and subtractions per recursive call.

We still assume that n is an exact power of 2. Computes the four C11, C12, C21, C22 submatrices in four steps:
1. If n = 1, just do multiplication and addition like normal in Θ(1) time, then return. Otherwise partition A and B and output matrix C into n/2 by n/2 submatrices. This step takes Θ(1) time.
2. Create n/2 by n/2 matrices S1, S2, ..., S10, each of which is the sum or difference of two submatrices in part 1. Create and zero the entries of 7 n/2 by n/2 matrices P1, P2, ..., P7 to hold 7 n/2 by n/2 matrix products. All 17 matrices can be created, and the Pi initialized, in Θ($n^2$) time.
3. Using the submatrices from step one and the S matrices, recursively compute each of the seven matrix products P, taking 7T(n/2) time.
4. Update C11, C12, C21, C22 of the result matrix C by adding or subtracting various Pi matrices, which takes Θ(n^2) time.

We'll see the details later. Let's look at the recurrence first. Steps 1, 2, and 4 take a total of Θ(n^2) time, and step 3 does 7 recursive calls.
T(n) = 7T(n/2) + Θ(n^2).

Now we can look at the details
# Step 2
Creates the 10 matrices:

This step adds or subtracts n/2 by n/2 matrices 10 times, taking Θ(n^2) time. 

# Step 3
Recursively multiplies n/2 by n/2 matrices 7 times to compute the following matrices, which is the sum or difference of the products shown on the right of the second equals signs.

# Step 4
Adds to and subtracts from the four n/2 by n/2 submatrices of the product C the various Pi matrices created in step 3.

This happens for the other 3 submatrices of C as well. Since we add or subtract n/2 by n/2 matrices 12 times in this step, it take ϴ($n^2$) time (no, i don't know why $n^2$ but I don't care enough).
